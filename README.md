# Book-Cover-recognition-book-search-with-cover
The purpose of this project is to recognize book covers from images that are taken by a regular digital camera, or already stored in computer or mobile or a webcam. The recognition will be made through image processing techniques, using de-skew algorithm, that will allow to identify the correct image that represents the cover from a database of covers. The input images will consist of a book cover and a background were the book was placed. When visiting bookstores, people always want to find more details about the book they are interested. Generally, we want to know more comments on that book, we may also want to compare the prices for the same book from online stores. Therefore, the goal of our project is to provide readers with more book information by just taking photos of the book cover. In this way, people can make better decisions on taking books in the bookstore.
